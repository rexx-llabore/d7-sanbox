Fixed for duplicated .slick__arrow on resizing.

Slick 7.x-1.0-dev, 2014-08-2
----------------------------
issue #2309681 by immoreel: Added support for Omega 3 expecting classes_array.
Do not output slide__media wrapper if no main image and caption available. The
  case, e.g., main image left empty, and overlay image/media filled out.

Slick 7.x-1.0-dev, 2014-07-25
-----------------------------
Added empty_option to Lazyload to allow sharing to Pinterest for small slides,
  since current Lazyload is a must, and img SRC attributes is always empty.

Slick 7.x-1.0-dev, 2014-07-24
-----------------------------
Issue #2308591 by jmuzz:
- Fixed for specificity of breakpoints states.
- Remove wasted breakpoint dependent options if disabled, even if not empty.
- Fixed CSS overriden checkboxes for admin settings.

Slick 7.x-1.0-dev, 2014-07-18
-----------------------------
Dropped slick-carousel.tpl.php, template_preprocess_slick_carousel() from
  slick.theme.inc
Dropped deprecated theme_slick_carousel() in favor of the unified theme_slick()
  for custom coded, Field formatter and Views for easy maintenance.

Slick 7.x-1.0-dev, 2014-07-13
-----------------------------
Added color_field support to Field Collection to colorize the slide text.
Fixed for Strict warning: Declaration of SlickViewsPluginStyleSlick::render()
  should be compatible with views_plugin_style::render() in
  _registry_check_code() (line 3139 ..., neglecting coder sniffs: "No scope
  modifier specified for function "render"
  [sniffer_squiz_scope_methodscope_missing]"
Added settings variables to template_preprocess_slick_item
Limit colorbox resize to non-images at slick.colorbox.js under onComplete.

Slick 7.x-1.0-dev, 2014-07-05
-----------------------------
Separated rules for slick.colorbox.css from slick.media.css
Started integration with Scald module as a separate project Scald Slick module.

Slick 7.x-1.0-dev, 2014-06-26
-----------------------------
Marked this feature complete for 1.3.6.
Added new options for future 1.3.7:
  - prevArrow
  - nextArrow
  - pauseOnDotsHover
   Latest Slick 1.3.6 is currently still buggy with responsive options not being
   read.

Added compatibility with Omega 4 which declares attributes_array already.

Slick 7.x-1.0-dev, 2014-06-24
-----------------------------
Added JS callbacks, see slick.api.js. Modules and themes may implement any of
  the Slick methods to interact with the Slick using Drupal.slick.callbacks
  namespace. JS Gurus, improvements are very much welcome.
Fixed inheritance issue with custom responsive options, including arrows wrapper
  and thumbnails.
Removed the thumbnail markups from slick.tpl.php, and its related leftover
  elsewhere.
Moved thumbnails inside slides, rather than separate list.

Slick 7.x-1.0-dev, 2014-06-23
-----------------------------
Removed two dup and useless problematic options from responsive options: slide
  and lazyLoad, since both _must inherit from the main settings.
Fixed scrolling behavior on colorbox closing, Drupal.slickColorbox.jumpScroll.
Changed skin Classic to reveal captions on active-slide rather than hover. To
  reveal it on hover, override and edit slick.theme--classic.css and replace
  .slick-active starting from line #96, and use pseudo :hover instead.
Added mousewheel option to slick_fields.module.
Fixed undefined index media_switch at slick_fields form.
Changed <div class="slick__arrow"> to <nav class="slick__arrow"> at slick.tpl
  as the last fail safe against the problematic anonymous DIV slide option. It
	is not an issue if data is passed into theme_slick() already. However copying
	the template and creating a custom theme without being aware of the issue will
	break the slide.

Slick 7.x-1.0-dev, 2014-06-16
-----------------------------
Fixed broken arrows due to problematic default anonymous DIV by forcing specific
  class .slick__slide to slide option.
Renamed and reorganized all CSS files to match Drupal 8 file organization, see
  https://drupal.org/node/1887922

Slick 7.x-1.0-dev, 2014-06-13
-----------------------------
Added slick-views.tpl.php to satisfy Views UI template discovery.

Slick 7.x-1.0-dev, 2014-06-11
-----------------------------
Added thumbnail pager option.
Changed _slick_fields_get_media_thumbnail() to be reusable for thumbnail pagers.
Fixed Youtube URL not playing inside Colorbox due to missing external params.
Fixed checkboxes states with checked attributes at admin pages.
Added autoplay to Colorbox audio/video.

Slick 7.x-1.0-dev, 2014-06-09
-----------------------------
Added API file containing skin information.
Added more Views options to have consistent markups with the Field version.

Slick 7.x-1.0-dev, 2014-06-08
-----------------------------
Added optional Colorbox intergration to display image or video inside Colorbox,
  or as an image to iframe switcher.

Slick 7.x-1.0-dev, 2014-06-07
-----------------------------

Added Sass versions for slick.skin.css and slick.media.css.
Added basic skins to support various slide layouts.
Added direct layout options for core Image field. Media and Field collection
  should use a separate field instead with some pre-defined options.
Added slick.make file to download relevant libraries. We don't name it.example
  to allow simplytest.me download the library.
Added title, captions and overlay fields for Field Collection and Media
Added options to break down Media and Field collection fields to support custom
  displays for slide title, description, overlay audio/video/image, link, and
  layout fields.
Added supports for Field collection at slick_fields.module.
Added Picture module integration.

Slick 7.x-1.0-dev, 2014-05-25
-----------------------------
Added admin CSS and JS to make nice CTools UI.
Added responsive display options, and additional custom options.
Added slick.media.js to allow image to iframe switcher.
Reworked JS settings in the head to only output base defaults alone, with no
  extra items. Individual JS settings are stored as data attributes, only single
  one now.
Reworked the theme functions to merge HTML5 data attributes to store JS settings
  as a single JSON object within the Slick container rather than regular JS
  settings in the <head>.
Simplified logic at module slick.js. JS should not do hard work with typecast
  or parse separate multiple data attributes, PHP does. JS is now ready to
  consume valid JSON object, or nothing. This is relevant where bunch of JS
  settings with responsive displays get in.
Renamed module slick.js into slick.load.js, to avoid conflict with the library
  for debug purposes.
Renamed slick.css into slick.skin.css, otherwise Drupal overrides the library.
Renamed "theme" directory into "templates" for Drupal 8 auto discovery goodness.
Deprecating theme_carousel in favor of theme_slick. Will deprecate it, not yet.
Deleted slick.views.inc and slick_plugin_style_slick.inc files, and use a
  separate slick_views.module instead.

Added CTools plugin for exportable configuration via optionsets.
Added dependencies on CTools, and libraries modules at slick.info file.
Added supports for Image, and Media at slick_fields.module.
Added 2 sub-modules: slick_views and slick_fields.
Added slick.install to install database table for optionsets.
Added the file CHANGELOG.txt.
by gausarts: Reworked some architecture.
